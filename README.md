# R-Art
Digital art in the making

This is where I nerd out by combining two of my many, many hobbies - drawing and coding.

It is completely curiosity driven, and there will be significant reinvention of wheels. 

So, if you happen to come across this repo and thought, "Hey, somebody already did that!", or "I have a better idea for a project!", please do message or pull or whatever you need to get my attention (I'm still new to git at this point). 

All comments, contributors, and collaborators welcome!
